## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. That will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Run

To open this project locally, download the project then open `index.html`

## ES6 & Jquery

I used many ES6 methods & some Jquery, i used
- `arrow functions`
- `const & let` declaration
- `IntersectionObserver`

These thing are working with the latest browsers except IE 11, IE 10.

## Changes
Almost all changes have happened in the `js/app.js` file & some few changes in `index.html` & very few changes in the styling `css/styles.css`
